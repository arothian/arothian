### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am senior engineer that enjoys learning and applying best practices. 
My goal is to serve other developers and treat them as my customers while promoting DevOps culture. 
I work hard supporting my team with tools, security and pipelines enabling them to ship code quickly and effectively.
